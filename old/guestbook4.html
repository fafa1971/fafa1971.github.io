Apart, perhaps, when you were "contributing" to one of my "capture the hearts and minds" Libra sessions, you know that I have always valued your company, humour and zest and enthusiasm for life.  I only wish I had met up with you international guys about 20 years earlier so I too could have enjoyed all of the sights, sounds, smells and illnesses that you have experienced.<br>I'm sure you know that I couldn't miss the chance to remind you once again of our trip to Colombia.  For me it was such a new and exciting challenge and for you, of course, it was the time that Keith Moss and I awarded you Breakfaster of the Year and Driver of the Decade titles.  That Bogota traffic and the state of the roads was the worst I had ever experienced.  Your driving was so bad and inconsiderate that you met the locals head on and won.  It was just a pity that Keith and I had to go through the experience for 3 hours every day.<br>Well done in getting to 60 and I wish you continued health, happiness and success in the future.<br>David Vaughan</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

Tim must be about the last of the old guard in Inspection.<br> I don't know that I have any amusing anecdotes but I do have very strong memories of lunch times in LBI days, which took place on the top floor of the Queen Victoria Street building, when politics was the main subject of discussion/violent argument. Ours was not the most right-wing table there, but among others, Chris Miller sat there, often with Tim. Tim and Chris were at the extreme ends of the spectrum with Chris, belonging to the TA at the time, always anxious to get in his tank and set off for Moscow, and Tim always trying
to put sugar in his petrol tank. Tim usually held his own very well against formidable opposition. I think politics was Tim's main extra-mural activity at the time so he probably benefited from the occasion.<br>I had forgotten about Bygravian Bolivars, which now you mention them, I recall were a significant part of the test data for our computer system, as was the main customer and account holder, Sir Jeremy Mouse. I think Tim always inspected these with special care.<br>Regards<br>Nick</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><br>

I've always enjoyed our talks and regret only that they haven't been more frequent.

Tim has been there, done it and bought the T-Shirt (XXL). Never lost for words, in fact never lost for anything. If you forgot something on an audit, young Oxton would have one in his case - it may have been a bit battered but he would have it. Judging by his always ruddy boyish complexion I suspect in a little bit of Max Factor was also present in his case!!<br>Always there in the thick of it, Tim was like Alan Knott (Kent wicketkeeper), catching anything that went past the younger auditors. His love of cricket was something we had in common unlike are breakfast habits. This man has to be given the title of  'All English freestyle breakfast eating champion 1975 to 1999'.  I was very nervous on my first audit with Tim, so much so that I spent most of the first morning having bowel movements which he would have classed as High Risk.. had they been assessed. It took all my effort to walk into the breakfast room and not return to the loo on seeing his plate choc-a-block full of assorted cheeses, hams and fried sausages and the time only 6.45am....<br>Of the audits themselves you could not of wished for more help and encouragement. Although his instance on a perfectly written report resulted in many a thrown scrap of A4 hitting a wall at a speed that even Brian Lara would have found difficult to hit. However, for all his help on our trips together I would like to thank him again.<br>Finally I would also like to say that a letter he wrote trying to prolong my stay in Computer Audit was one of the nicest compliments I have ever received from anyone and just sums up what a nice guy he is.<br>I could say a few more things but he has got away with them over the years and now is not the time to ask him for the fiver he owes me for a cab fare we took in Madrid - but still we shouldn't have been there in that part of town in the first place!!!!!<br>Best wishes<br>Rick Talbot  (star of stage, screen and Linnet).<br>Good luck in your retirement Tim</FONT></TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE><br>
