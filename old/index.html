<param name="TEXT1" value="Timothy Oxton was born in 1941 at Layer de la Haye, near Colchester, Essex.  His earliest memories">
<param name="TEXT2" value="include seeing doodlebugs flying overhead in the Second World War, and working in his father's shipyard.">
<param name="TEXT3" value=" ">
<param name="TEXT4" value="When he was at school, aged about 15, he appeared in a play by Aristophanes called 'Batrachoi' ('The Frogs').">  
<param name="TEXT5" value="Several boys, including himself, played the part of frogs. At various points in the action they had to say">  
<param name="TEXT6" value="'brekekekex koax koax', which was how Aristophanes thought frogs spoke.">
<param name="TEXT7" value="He was classically educated at Radley and Trinity Hall, Cambridge, where his crowning achievement was">
<param name="TEXT8" value="playing the part of Socrates in an Arts Theatre play.  His entrance on stage was dramatic - he was lowered">
<param name="TEXT9" value="from the ceiling in a basket, but luckily at that time he did not possess the size he does today and the theatre">
<param name="TEXT10" value="survived structurally intact.">
<param name="TEXT11" value=" ">
<param name="TEXT12" value="Just when he was completing his education, the family shipbuilding business went bankrupt due to">
<param name="TEXT13" value="competition from abroad, and young Timothy had to leave home to make a living.  He decided to head for">
<param name="TEXT14" value="warmer climes, and moving to San Sebastian in Spain's Basque country, where he taught English.  He">
<param name="TEXT15" value="integrated well into European life, so after further teaching appointments in Islington and Oxford, he">
<param name="TEXT16" value="moved on to Sicily where he continued as an English teacher.">
<param name="TEXT17" value=" ">
<param name="TEXT18" value="It was in Siracusa (Sicily) that he met his wife, Anna Di Giovanni, at a lecture about penguins.  Before">
<param name="TEXT19" value="long, his father warned Timothy that it would not be possible to raise a family on the basis of a teacher's">
<param name="TEXT20" value="salary, and propelled Timothy into the then new profession of computer programming.  Before long, an">
<param name="TEXT21" value="opportunity arose to work as a programmer/analyst with a market research company in Milan.  After a">
<param name="TEXT22" value="while Timothy moved on to the local Price Waterhouse office as an IT consultant and auditor.  In 1972, the">
<param name="TEXT23" value="family, now with two children, Katy and Thomas, moved back to the ancestral home in Essex, which was">
<param name="TEXT24" value="Timothy's base for another six years in IT consultancy and audit, this time with Deloitte, Haskins and Sells.">
<param name="TEXT25" value=" ">
<param name="TEXT26" value="With this background, he was recruited into Lloyds Bank International in 1978 to manage the recently">
<param name="TEXT27" value="created IT Audit function, where his team included Jorge Shaw from Argentina and a former LBI">
<param name="TEXT28" value="programmer, Stuart O'Nions.  From London he sallied forth to most of the Bank's overseas operations,">
<param name="TEXT29" value="which continued unabated until his last audit in November 2000.">
<param name="TEXT30" value=" ">
<param name="TEXT31" value="His boundless enthusiasm for the people and cultures of all the countries he visited during this period is">
<param name="TEXT32" value="well known to Bank staff worldwide.  His house is so full of souvenirs brought back from these 22 years of">
<param name="TEXT33" value="travels that he has had to keep on the road because there is now very little room for him to live in it. One of">
<param name="TEXT34" value="his best-known collections is that of airline sick bags: early in his career in the Bank he was a founder">
<param name="TEXT35" value="member of LASBAG - the Lloyds Air Sickness Bag Accumulators Group.  Two of the other three members">
<param name="TEXT36" value="retired years ago; the other never worked for Lloyds.">
<param name="TEXT37" value=" ">
<param name="TEXT38" value="Indeed, his collecting instinct is something he inherited from his father, who left to Timothy four suitcases">
<param name="TEXT39" value="full of ties.  Since his father's death, Timothy has been able to come to work wearing a different tie every">
<param name="TEXT40" value="day, although some of the earlier items from the collection, dating from his father's schooldays, did not">
<param name="TEXT41" value="really do justice to his now portly figure.">
