Those file reviews will just have to wait a little longer.

<param name="TEXT5" value="My name is Gary and I have worked with Tim for the last 4 years.  A comparatively short  period">
<param name="TEXT6" value="in such a distinguished career but I am privileged to be able to give you some of my recollections.">
<param name="TEXT7" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT8" value="Tim was recruited into Lloyds Bank International in 1978 as manager of the newly created IT Audit">
<param name="TEXT9" value="function. He was working alongside a former LBI programmer, Stuart O'Nions.">
<param name="TEXT10" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT11" value="Tim then began a series of world tours which have continued unabated until his last audit in">
<param name="TEXT12" value="November 2000.  His boundless enthusiasm for the people and cultures of all the countries he visited">
<param name="TEXT13" value="during this period is well known to Bank staff worldwide.">
<param name="TEXT14" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT15" value="His house is so full of souvenirs brought back from these 22 years of travels that he has been">
<param name="TEXT16" value="forced to keep on the road because there is now very little room for him to live in it.">
<param name="TEXT17" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT18" value="One of his most well-known collections is that of airline sick bags - early in his career in the">
<param name="TEXT19" value="Bank he was a founder member of LASBAG - the Lloyds Air Sick Bag Accumulation Group (the other">
<param name="TEXT20" value="members of which have since sunk into obscurity). Officianados will of course know that there is a">
<param name="TEXT21" value="web site available for collectors the splendidly named www.vomitarium.com">
<param name="TEXT22" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT23" value="This collecting instinct is apparently inherited from his father along with an impressive collection">
<param name="TEXT24" value="of neckties - four suitcases full to be precise.  As a  result Tim has been able to come to work">
<param name="TEXT25" value="wearing a different tie every day, although some of the earlier items from the collection, dating">
<param name="TEXT26" value="from his father's schooldays, did not really do justice to his now portly figure and were the cause">
<param name="TEXT27" value="of a number of citations from the style police.">
<param name="TEXT28" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT29" value="Tim has accumulated more than  300,000 Plus Air Miles on his travels and by my calculations that">
<param name="TEXT30" value="should certainly take Tim and Anna around the world at a pace of their choosing.">
<param name="TEXT31" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT32" value="There can be few people who would be unable to recall an encounter with Tim."> 
<param name="TEXT33" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT34" value="He can be enlightening, amusing, interesting, entertaining, exasperating and at times infuriating"> 
<param name="TEXT35" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT36" value="He has the potential to deliver an awesome tongue lashing via the telephone but he is always full"> 
<param name="TEXT37" value="of remorse if, no when, he discovers that the recipient may have been just a teensy weensy bit upset."> 
<param name="TEXT38" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT39" value="A direct man who says what he thinks and holds a passionate belief that things should be done properly"> 
<param name="TEXT40" value="both at a personal and professional level."> 
<param name="TEXT41" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT42" value="Tim does not agree with comments that are made behind people's backs - an admirable philosophy and"> 
<param name="TEXT43" value="Tim does indeed follow it to the letter by copying in anybody that he refers to adversely in"> 
<param name="TEXT44" value="correspondence. Funnily enough some of these people can be less enthusiastic about Tim's open and direct"> 
<param name="TEXT45" value="manner. I have discussed the improvement opportunities with Tim and it is in his personal development"> 
<param name="TEXT46" value="plan for 2001."> 
<param name="TEXT47" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT48" value="Imagine Tim as a witness in court.  When asked  'Do you promise o tell the truth, the whole truth and"> 
<param name="TEXT49" value="nothing but the truth'  I believe that Tim would reply I do ...followed by 'well for a start you need"> 
<param name="TEXT50" value="to lose a few pounds, the judge is exceedingly bald, that juror in the second row is absolutely"> 
<param name="TEXT51" value="beautiful, this courtroom needs decorating' - ... "> 
<param name="TEXT52" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT53" value="I didn't really believe the tales about his legendary late nights in the office but since sharing a"> 
<param name="TEXT54" value="room with Tim I can confirm that it is all true.  He really does work until 8, 9, 10, 11 and even"> 
<param name="TEXT55" value="through the night.   He is definitely the only man I know who keeps a spare pair of pyjamas in the"> 
<param name="TEXT56" value="office."> 
<param name="TEXT57" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT58" value="Tim quite definitely has his own style of auditing:"> 
<param name="TEXT59" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT60" value="When Tim reviewed IT in a country he didn't just interview the IT staff - he interrogated absolutely"> 
<param name="TEXT61" value="everybody: Chauffeurs, cleaners, car park attendants, Comissionnaires and so on.  Information, no"> 
<param name="TEXT62" value="matter how trivial,  was gathered for potential subsequent use.   And used it was ... in some cases"> 
<param name="TEXT63" value="to substantiate a point  - in others to become items on one of the legendary 'to do lists' as items"> 
<param name="TEXT64" value="5923-5961. Tim's filing and retrieval system for this information is quite frightening. It spans years"> 
<param name="TEXT65" value="and there are files in the basement (nobody knows how many) that will continue to provide their own"> 
<param name="TEXT66" value="tribute to Tim... well at least until the next cull.  Several people have got their eyes on a 1994 TJLO">
<param name="TEXT67" value="file of 'Things to be reviewed'."> 
<param name="TEXT68" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT69" value="I digress - back to the audits...What Tim achieved by talking to all these people was an understanding"> 
<param name="TEXT70" value="of the culture, the background, the personalities, the politics, the standard of internal communication,"> 
<param name="TEXT71" value="the level of morale etc. etc."> 
<param name="TEXT72" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT73" value="He also ascertained the form of the local football team (for any younsgters out there this tactic works"> 
<param name="TEXT74" value="in 9 times out of ten except for the USA), the local perfoming arts,  the best places to eat, local"> 
<param name="TEXT75" value="events, the local economy, other places to eat, local news, the price of fish....... "> 
<param name="TEXT76" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT77" value="Basically he did his best to appreciate the local environment that Lloyds TSB were doing business in."> 
<param name="TEXT78" value="Along the way Tim established  a rapport with many many people and set up a magnificent network of"> 
<param name="TEXT79" value="business colleagues that regularly seek advice and guidance from Tim"> 
<param name="TEXT80" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT81" value="I couldn't omit a reference to a special lady who has been a constant nuisance to Tim for the last 6"> 
<param name="TEXT82" value="years. I refer of course to Gracie and annual appraisal after annual appraisal incorporated Tim's avowed"> 
<param name="TEXT83" value="intent to start using it.  I can confirm that it has been included in his objectives for 2001."> 
<param name="TEXT84" value=" "> 
<param name="TEXT85" value="An individual's contribution to a team and an organisation can be considered quite simply in terms of the"> 
<param name="TEXT86" value="resultant gap when they are not around.  In Tim's case that gap will be very large indeed.">

<param name="TEXT88" value="Thanks for all your efforts over the years, you have been an excellent colleague.">
